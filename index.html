  <h1>Welcome to the loan calculator and amortization table website.</h1>
  <h2>This site is intended to show you a payment schedule based off of your loan amount, your down payment, the loan duration,
    and your credit score.  With this website, you can get a general idea of what to expect when you take out a loan.  Depending on
    whether you are buying a car or a home, your credit score will determine your interest rate and the amount of down payment required.
    It will then show you a payment schedule displaying each month's payment, broken down to interest paid, principal paid, and total
    amount remaining.</h2>
